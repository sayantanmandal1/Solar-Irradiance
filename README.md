Solar Irradiance Estimation Project
This project provides a model for estimating solar irradiance using data collected from Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs). By leveraging machine learning, this system converts raw data from LDRs into accurate irradiance readings, which are essential for applications in solar energy optimization, environmental monitoring, and climate analysis.

Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to create an efficient and cost-effective solution for estimating solar irradiance by using low-cost sensors. LDRs are inexpensive and easy to deploy but have limitations in directly measuring irradiance. This project overcomes these limitations by using machine learning algorithms to map LDR data to accurate irradiance readings, providing a viable alternative to traditional, more expensive solar measurement devices.

Workflow
Data Collection:

Multiple LDR sensors were used to collect light intensity data under varying conditions of sunlight (different times of day, weather conditions, etc.).
The data collection setup includes LDRs connected to a microcontroller, which records light intensity levels in different environmental conditions.
Data Preprocessing:

Collected data was cleaned and normalized to ensure consistency.
Outliers due to environmental noise or sensor anomalies were identified and handled.
Additional environmental data, such as temperature and humidity, were optionally incorporated to improve model accuracy.
Machine Learning Model:

A supervised learning approach was employed to train the model.
LDR readings were labeled with corresponding irradiance values using reference data from a calibrated solar pyranometer.
Several machine learning algorithms (such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks) were evaluated, and the best-performing model was selected based on accuracy and robustness.
Model Evaluation and Optimization:

The model was tested with unseen data to evaluate performance.
Various performance metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), were used to assess accuracy.
Hyperparameter tuning was conducted to optimize model performance for real-world scenarios.
Deployment:

The model can be deployed on low-power microcontrollers or embedded devices, allowing for real-time irradiance estimation.
Real-time data can be accessed via an interface or dashboard for monitoring and analysis.
Results
The machine learning model achieved a high degree of accuracy, successfully converting LDR readings to approximate irradiance values with minimal error.
The system provides a low-cost, scalable solution for monitoring solar irradiance and is suitable for deployment in various solar energy and environmental applications.
